Implement A* struct + methods:
    Two versions: 
        1. Naive (on raw PRM data) 
        2. Optimized (on prepared structure).
    Lookup Benchmark: Compare lookups between random (free) points:
        1. Get two random free points in PRM
        2. Do shortest path.


Implement Set-union:
    Store blocked edges per obstacle. And add prepare / incremental prepare.

    Prepare Benchmark variants:
        1a. Full prepare simple.
        1b. Full prepare blocked-per-obstacle.
        2a. Incremental Bounded CRDT.
        2b. Incremental Blocked-per-obstacle.

App Deployment modes:
    Edge Query + Compute single instance.
    Edge Query + Cloud Offload Compute Large / Small instances
    Edge Query + Edge Offload Compute Large instance
    Edge Query + Edge Offload Compute Small instances
